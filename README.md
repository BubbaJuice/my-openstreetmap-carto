Carto with real changes. 

The general purpose, the cartographic design goals and guidelines for this style are outlined in [CARTOGRAPHY.md](CARTOGRAPHY.md).

These stylesheets can be used in your own cartography projects, and are designed
to be easily customised. They work with [Kosmtik](https://github.com/kosmtik/kosmtik)
 and also with the command-line [CartoCSS](https://github.com/mapbox/carto) processor.

They are easily used with Docker.

## Docker
